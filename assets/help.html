<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>I've always been a big fan of interactive fiction (or text adventures, as they were called back in my ZX Spectrum days) and think that
smartphones should be ideal for playing them on the move.  However, the existing interpreters on the Android store all had some feature
that rendered them less than suitable, in my opinion.  Dreadful input (<em>ie.</em> not the Android default on-screen keyboard),
ugly text, inexplicable slowness, a tendency to crash, or some combination of the above, seemed to be common features.  So I set out to write
my own, ensuring that it would crash quickly, at least...

<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Display text size</strong> Changes the size of text in the game selection menu and in games.  Screen width is set at the 
start of each game, and the game is told that the screen is at least 80 columns by 24 rows -- some games won't start with smaller screens,
and it's annoying to have to squint to be even able to play.   If you've set a large font, you might have to do some scrolling to see
everything, some things won't be centered, and <q>quote boxes</q> will look quite ugly.  But at least you'll be able to read it.

<li><p><strong>Enable sound effects</strong> Currently only the two basic beeps are implemented, high and low pitched.
These usually provide feedback on scoring or unrecognised input.

<li><p><strong>Enable colour</strong> Most colour games (<em>eg.</em> Adam Cadre's works) are polite enough to ask before you start,
but it's possible to disable colour entirely, here.

<li><p><strong>Report minor errors in story files</strong> A number of non-fatal errors can be present in story files, which can
usually be ignored without affecting play.  Usually only useful for story authors while debugging.

<li><p><strong>Length of scroll back</strong> The bottom screen has scrollback enabled.  This number shown is the number of screen
updates which are preserved.  Having too many items eventually slows down the phone, and would eventually lead to memory problems.
50 is about appropriate on my S5, but you might want to increase or decrease this depending on how puissant your device is.

<li><p><strong>Speed of automatic scrolling</strong> I've implemented automatic scroll-forward for when large amounts of text is
displayed.  A setting of about 3 gives the right reading speed for me; might depend on the speed of your device, too.

<li><p><strong>Run pirated story files</strong> There is a <span class="opcode">@piracy</span> opcode on the Z-Machine, which causes different story file execution
if the game is detected to have been obtained by copyright infringement.  This checkbox is the detection mechanism.  <em>nb.</em> this
is completely useless, and essentially unused in all but demonstration story files.
</ul>

<h2 id="notes">Technical notes</h2>
<p>Some games (eg. Anchorhead while reading books) require cursor key input, which isn't present on (my) Android phone.  There are some
keyboard shortcuts present on the action bar (cursor up/down/left/right, delete, return) that simulate the desired keys.
<p>The z-spec suggests that it would be beneficial to implement the Quetzal save file format, to allow save game exchange between devices
and interpreters.  The spec is biased towards a C-style implementation of callstacks and frame pointers; this implementation uses Java
serialisation for save (and undo) which would make this a pain.  Also, because Xyzzy saves games in its private use area (and thus doesn't
require write privileges), you'd need a rooted device to get to your saves, anyway.

<h2 id="complete">Games That Have Been Tested To Completion</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A Change In The Weather</p>
<li><p>Photopia</p>
</ul>

<h2 id="todo">To-do list</h2>
<p>The following opcodes are unsupported</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="opcode">@throw</span> and <span class="opcode">@catch</span>: using these opcodes will cause a crash.
Unfortunately, the z-code specification doesn't make sense to me. If anyone can drop me a line clearing up (exactly) what these should do,
I'll be happy to work them in.
<li><p><span class="opcode">@sound_effect</span> only implements the standard beeps.  Enjoy the extra feedback scoring points in Trinity.
<li><p><span class="opcode">@input_stream</span> does nothing.
<li><p>The V6 opcodes (drawing pictures, moving windows, detecting the mouse, etc) all do nothing.
</ul>

<h2 id="contact">Contact me</h2>
<p>My email contact is <a href="mailto:addiemacgruer@googlemail.com">addiemacgruer@googlemail.com</a> for feedback or queries.
<p>The code is kept at <a href="https://code.google.com/p/xyzzy/">https://code.google.com/p/xyzzy/</a>.  There's a bug tracker on
there, and if you can find where my code is wrong, that would be even more helpful.
<p>If you've managed to play another story to completion, then that would be handy to add to the list.
<p>If the interpreter has crashed, or is displaying peculiar behaviour, then it would be helpful to know what game you were playing
(and what you were doing) when it did.  If a stack trace has displayed, then the name of the exception and the top line which starts with
<q>at uk.addie.xyzzy....</q> (including the line number) would be very helpful.
